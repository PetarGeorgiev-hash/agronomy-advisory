        <h2>Agricultural Tips</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Crop Rotation:</strong>
            <p>
              Crop rotation is a practice where different crops are planted in the same field in successive seasons. It helps improve soil health, reduce pest and disease pressure, and increase crop yields. By rotating crops, you can balance nutrient levels in the soil, break pest cycles, and maintain soil structure.
            </p>
          </li>

            <strong>Soil Testing and Fertilizer Management:</strong>
            <p>
              Regularly test your soil to determine its nutrient content. Based on the results, you can apply the appropriate fertilizers in the right quantities. Proper fertilizer management ensures that crops receive the necessary nutrients while preventing overuse, which can harm the environment.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Water Management:</strong>
            <p>
              Efficient water management is crucial in agriculture, especially in regions with limited water resources. Implement irrigation systems that reduce water wastage, such as drip irrigation or sprinklers. Monitor soil moisture levels to provide crops with the right amount of water, preventing both drought stress and waterlogging.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Pest and Disease Control:</strong>
            <p>
              Implement integrated pest management (IPM) techniques to control pests and diseases while minimizing the use of chemical pesticides. This may involve the use of biological controls, crop rotation, and resistant crop varieties. Regular scouting and early detection are also important to address issues before they become severe.
